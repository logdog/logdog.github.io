My wife and I enjoy playing board games with each other. Just before I started my PhD, I decided to spend a weekend making a game board for three of our favorite games: chinese checkers, cribbage, and carbles!

#### Tools required:
* Plunge Router with Cove Bit
* Drill
* CAD Software (I used Fusion)
* Printer and Scissors
* Spring-loaded Punch or Awl

#### Materials required:
* 15" diameter glued pine circle
* 60 marbles (6 sets of 10)
* Tape
* Sandpaper

## Creating the Template

Chinese checkers requires 121 equally-spaced holes. A CNC machine would have been really nice for this project, but I don't own one of those (yet!). However, I do have a plunge router which makes excellent holes nontheless. Given my toolset, the easiest way for me to get the design onto the wood was to create a template, print it out, and then mark the holes using a spring-loaded punch. This also gave me the opportunity to mark the cribbage board holes (another 367 holes).

Before creating the template, I tested a variety of different hole depths by plunge-routing into a piece scrap wood until I found a depth which held the marble securely, while still making it easy to pick up with my fingers. I also played around with the spacing between the holes, and tested how accurately I could route them by hand.

I created the template using Fusion 360, and then printed it onto 4 sheets of paper. Then, using scissors and tape I created the paper template you above. It took me two tries to create a properly sized template, since as it turns out, the circular wood piece I bought from Menards isn't a perfect circle, which you might be able to observe in the template. But in the finished product you really can't tell unless you're looking for it!

## Drilling the Holes

Once the holes were marked, I used my plunge router with a cove bit to cut out spots for the marbles to sit in. The router has a tendency to move laterally when the plunger is lowered into the wood, so it was a challenge to keep all of the holes lined up perfectly straight! But hey, now you can tell it was homemade!

For the cribbage board ring, I just used a drill with tape marking the depth of cut, and go to work! It took me less than an hour to drill all 367 holes in the cribbage board, which I feel is a win.

## Finishing Touches

I opted to simply sand down the wood to 220 grit and not add any stain. I quite like the feel of the raw wood, and I was a bit worried that the stain might pool in all of the holes, creating dark spots, or clogging up the small cribbage peg holes.

## Creating Carbles

I also love the game of Carbles, which I learned during my Master's Degree. It is very similar to _Sorry!_ but instead of rolling a die, you are dealt a hand of cards, which makes this more strategic than you would expect. I created a 4-player board sice the gameplay is much faster than a 6-person or 8-person setup, and it was really hard to try and fit enough holes onto the backside of the Chinese Checkers board!

I used the same process as before: create a template, cut it out, mark the holes, and start plunging! My second time around, I did a much better job and the lines are pretty straight.

One fun touch I added was a hole in the middle. This is not standard in every Carbles board, but the rule is that if your marble would finish one hole past an inside corner, you can instead move to the center of the board to end your turn, instead of rounding the corner. On a future move, you continue by moving to _any_ inside corner you'd like. This really helps getting marbles around the board quickly, but you leave your marble quite exposed, which makes for an exciting twist to the game.

## Where Can I Get Templates?

Unfortunately, I no longer have Fusion360 and so I don't have my templates anymore. However, if there is interest (or I want to make another board) I might make a new template and put it on Etsy. Let me know if you'd be interested!
